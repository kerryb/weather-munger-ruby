A ruby implementation of the [Weather Munger](http://codekata.com/kata/kata04-data-munging/) kata.

Probably a bit over-the-top in terms of separation of concerns!

Interesting (for small values of interesting) points on the journey:

* [Integration test with slimed implementation](https://github.com/kerryb/weather-munger-ruby/tree/a2c41e5)
* [Top-level orchestration class, tested with doubles](https://github.com/kerryb/weather-munger-ruby/tree/0e55d8b)
* [Implement all the collaborating classes](https://github.com/kerryb/weather-munger-ruby/tree/94f71a1)
* [Put it all together!](https://github.com/kerryb/weather-munger-ruby/tree/69f7119)
